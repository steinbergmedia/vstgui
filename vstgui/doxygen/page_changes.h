@section version4_introduction Introduction

Version 4 of VSTGUI is a new milestone release with a restructured code base with the focus of code conformity and easier future enhancements.
The result is that code written for any earlier version of VSTGUI is not always compatible.
It's recommended to start new projects with version 4 while old projects should stay with version 3.6.

@section code_changes Changes for existing VSTGUI code

@subsection code_changes_4_3_to_4_5 VSTGUI 4.3 -> VSTGUI 4.5

- COffscreenContext::create returns a SharedPointer<COffscreenContext> now, not a naked pointer.

@subsection code_changes_4_2_to_4_3 VSTGUI 4.2 -> VSTGUI 4.3

- CControlListener was renamed to IControlListener and moved into the VSTGUI namespace and its own header file. A typedef for CControlListener is available but marked as deprecated.
- the VSTGUI::CDrawContext::drawString methods don't set the clip to rect by itself anymore. If you call this method in your code, you need to set the clip yourself now.
- the interfaces for VSTGUI::IController and VSTGUI::IViewCreator have changed and if you have inherited from them you need to change your implementations accordingly.
- the enum DragResult was moved out of CView into VSTGUI namespace
- VSTGUI::CGradient can now be created without a VSTGUI::CDrawContext object
- VSTGUI::CGradientView takes now a VSTGUI::CGradient. Setting the gradient colors and start offsets are removed.
- VSTGUI::CTextButton takes now VSTGUI::CGradient objects instead of colors and start offsets.
- method signature change for: VSTGUI::CViewContainer::getViewAt, VSTGUI::CViewContainer::getViewsAt, VSTGUI::CViewContainer::getContainerAt
- Some methods changed its arguments or return types from a signed type to an unsigned type, check your overrides !

@subsection code_changes_4_1_to_4_2 VSTGUI 4.1 -> VSTGUI 4.2

- the class CDragContainer is replaced by IDataPackage. The class CDragContainerHelper is a helper class you can use to quickly get your code up and running again.
- the class IDataBrowser is renamed to IDataBrowserDelegate and the drag and drop methods have changed
- CView::getVisibleSize () was renamed to CView::getVisibleViewSize ()

@subsection code_changes_4_0_to_4_1 VSTGUI 4.0 -> VSTGUI 4.1

- the pBackground member of CView is now private. You must replace all read access with getDrawBackground () or getBackground () and all write access with setBackground ()

@subsection code_changes_3_6_to_4_0 VSTGUI 3.6 -> VSTGUI 4.0

- the variable types were changed to use C99 style types (int32_t, etc), you must do this for all your derivated VSTGUI classes too
- the buttons parameter has changed from long to CButtonState
- your custom views need to use the new mouse methods
- COptionMenuScheme is not available anymore
- VSTGUI::CFileSelector is gone, you have to use VSTGUI::CNewFileSelector
- VST extensions previously enabled via ENABLE_VST_EXTENSION_IN_VSTGUI is gone without replacement
- VSTGUI::CBitmap was completely changed and does not use a transparency color anymore, you need to use the alpha channel of a bitmap to get the same results
- VSTGUI::COffscreenContext is handled completely different. But in most cases you can simply remove all offscreens where you needed them to reduce flicker.
- On Windows graphics are entirely drawn with GDI+ or Direct2D (when available), GDI is not used anymore
- The internal string encoding is now always UTF-8
- The VSTGUI::CCoord type is now always a double
- on Mac OS X, embedding a CFrame into a non composited carbon window is not supported anymore
- on Mac OS X, when targeting Mac OS X 10.4 some of the graphics path methods are not implemented.

- Method signature changes which don't lead to compile errors:
	- CView::setViewSize (CRect& rect, bool invalid = true)
	- CView::hitTest (const CPoint& where, CButtonState& buttons = -1)
	- CView::invalidRect (CRect& rect)
	- CViewContainer::drawBackgroundRect (CDrawContext* pContext, CRect& _updateRect)
	- CViewContainer::addView (CView* pView, CRect& mouseableArea, bool mouseEnabled = true)

@section hidpi_support HiDPI notes
- HiDPI is supported on OSX, iOS and Windows (with Direct2D backend)
- Due to platform differences one need to call frame->setZoom (scaleFactor) on Windows, while on OSX and iOS this is not needed.
 
@section cocoa_support Cocoa notes

- To get cocoa support your minimum required Mac OS X version is 10.6.
- In 32 bit Cocoa and Carbon are available. You can switch between them with CFrame::setCocoaMode(bool state). You must do this before creating the CFrame.
- In 64 bit only Cocoa is available.
- The pSystemWindow pointer in the CFrame constructor must be a NSView not a NSWindow.

@section ios_support iOS support notes

- VSTGUI supports iOS 7 and later
- Currently COptionMenu, CScrollView and COpenGLView are not supported
- Support for a single MultiTouch View is not yet tested and the API may change in the future

@page page_previous_new_stuff New Stuff in VSTGUI 3.6 and earlier
 
@section new_mouse_methods New mouse methods

In earlier versions there were only one method in CView for handling mouse events (VSTGUI::CView::mouse). 
In this version there are five new methods :
- VSTGUI::CView::onMouseDown	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CView::onMouseUp	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CView::onMouseMoved	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CView::onMouseEntered	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CView::onMouseExited	(new in 3.5)

For convenience the old method is still working, but should be replaced with the ones above.

@section other_new_things Other new things

- VSTGUI::CDataBrowser	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CScrollView	(new in 3.0)
- VSTGUI::CTabView		(new in 3.0)

- Mac OS X 64 bit support via Cocoa. (new in 3.6)
- New Fileselector class : VSTGUI::CNewFileSelector (new in 3.6)
- VSTGUI::COptionMenu refactored. Supports icons for menu items. (new in 3.6)
- View autoresizing support. (new in 3.6)
- Bitmaps can be loaded either by number or by name (see VSTGUI::CBitmap)	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CTooltipSupport	(new in 3.5)
- VSTGUI::CVSTGUITimer	(new in 3.5)
- System event driven drawing	(new in 3.5)
- Unicode support via UTF-8 (new in 3.5)
- New font implementation	(new in 3.5)
- Windows GDI+ support	(new in 3.5)
- Mac OS X Composited Window support (new in 3.0)

@section about_deprecation About deprecation in version 3.6

With VSTGUI 3.6 the VSTGUI_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_METHODS macro has changed to be zero per default. You should change your code so that
it compiles without changing the macro. All methods marked this way will be unavailable in the next version.

@section code_changes_for_3_5 Code changes for existing VSTGUI 3.5 code

- COptionMenu was refactored and uses the CMenuItem class for menu items. Item flags are not encoded in the item title anymore.
- CParamDisplay::setTxtFace () and CParamDisplay::getTxtFace () is gone. The text face is already in CFontRef.
- You need to use the new CNewFileSelector class instead of CFileSelector if you want to use it on Mac 64 bit.

@section code_changes_for_3_0 Code changes for existing VSTGUI 3.0 code

- Per default CBitmaps don't get a transparent color on creation. You must call bitmap->setTransparency (color) explicitly. And this may only works once depending on the internal implementation.
- CViewContainer addView and removeView returns a bool value now.
- Mouse methods moved from CDrawContext to CFrame.
- Custom views which override attached and removed must propagate the call to the parent.
- VST specific code is enclosed with the macro ENABLE_VST_EXTENSION_IN_VSTGUI, which per default is set to zero. If you need them you must enable it (best practice is to set it in the prefix header or the preprocessor panel in your compiler).
- Removed all CDrawContext parameters from CView methods except for draw and drawRect. You need to change this in your custom views and controls.
- Every usage of CFont must be changed to CFontRef.
- When using GDI+ or libpng on Windows there is no need in using any offscreen context for flicker reduction as VSTGUI uses a backbuffer for drawing.
- Custom controls must implement the CLASS_METHODS macro if it directly inherits from CControl. Otherwise you will get a compile error.
- Custom controls which don't implement the new mouse methods must override onMouseDown and return kMouseEventNotHandled so that the old mouse method is called.

@subsection cviewchanges CView method changes

For custom views you need to change the following methods because their parameters changed:

- onWheel
- onDrop
- onDragEnter
- onDragLeave
- onDragMove
- takeFocus
- looseFocus
- setViewSize

@subsection aeffguieditorchanges AEffGUIEditor method changes

- valueChanged
